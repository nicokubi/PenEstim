\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer, the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.}

\item{n_iter}{Integer, the number of iterations to perform in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{burn_in}{Integer, the number of initial iterations to discard (burn-in period).}

\item{chain_id}{Integer, the identifier for the chain being executed.}

\item{ncores}{Integer, the number of cores to use for parallel computation.}

\item{data}{Data frame, containing family and genetic information used in the analysis.}

\item{twins}{Information on monozygous twins or triplets in the pedigrees.}

\item{max_age}{Integer, the maximum age considered in the analysis.}

\item{baseline_data}{Numeric vector, containing baseline risk estimates for different ages.}

\item{prior_distributions}{List, containing prior distributions for the parameters being estimated.}

\item{af}{Numeric, the allele frequency of the risk allele in the population.}

\item{median_max}{Logical, indicates if the maximum median age should be used for the Weibull distribution.}

\item{max_penetrance}{Numeric, the maximum penetrance value allowed.}

\item{BaselineNC}{Logical, indicates if non-carrier penetrance should be based on SEER data.}

\item{var}{Numeric, the variance for the proposal distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{ageImputation}{Logical, indicates if age imputation should be performed.}

\item{removeProband}{Logical, indicates if the proband should be removed from the analysis.}

\item{sex_specific}{Logical, set to FALSE since this function does not consider sex differentiation.}
}
\value{
A list containing samples, log likelihoods, acceptance ratio, and rejection rate for each iteration.
}
\description{
Performs a single chain execution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Bayesian inference,
specifically tailored for cancer risk estimation without considering sex differentiation.
It estimates parameters related to cancer penetrance based on family data, genetic information,
and baseline database estimates.
